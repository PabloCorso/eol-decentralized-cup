# Decentralized cup V2

The cup is inspired in decentralized systems in which something is accomplished without a central authority and with as little censorship as possible. In this case, anyone should be able to upload levels to the cup with as little censorship or limitations as possible, although because of technical limitations we certainly would need a central authority to do some minimum validations and managing of the online cup (e.g. manually checking that levels are freshly new).

Any player will be able to submit up to one level before the cup starts. All events will have the same deadline. If the total levels submitted exceed 10 levels, only the 10 most popular levels will count in the results. The popularity of a level is equal to its total playtime. Each player will have 1 skip from the final top 10 levels. For this top levels, the player points are calculated as in normal cups, without any skips.

## Cup rules and information

1. Any player will be able to submit up to one level before the cup starts.
   1. Submitted levels are first validated. Basic valid criteria:
      1. Levels must be new, un-remixed and comply to EOL rules.
      2. The level must look "finishable", but not in a trivial way as in 0 seconds.
      3. Level designers can (and probably should) play their own levels.
      4. The name follows the usual sequential pattern e.g. "Des1Cxxx.lev" or "D1Cupxxx.lev".
      5. At EOL, times and players are hidden.
1. Start of the cup.
   1. The cup is started with a set deadline (e.g. 1 month).
   2. All events have the same duration.
1. Only the X top ranked levels will count in the results.
   1. If the total levels submitted exceed 10 levels, only the 10 most popular levels will count in the results.
   1. The popularity of a level is equal to its total playtime.
   1. _[TBD]_ The ranking update could be shared during the cup, e.g. once a week.
1. End of the cup.
   1. All events finish along the cup deadline and only times finished online are taken into account, replays not required.
   2. The levels ranking freezes, and the final top 10 levels are revealed.
   3. For this top levels, the player points are calculated as in normal cups, without any skips.

## Technical limitations

Currently the cup would require some manual "centralized" orchestration to validate the levels, rename them, create the cup and events, calculate the levels ranking and update the cup results at the end.

For the ranking and end results (filtering top 10 levels from the results) might need some dev work.

For example:

- Allow disabling levels in the cup so that they don't count in the results.
- Make a SQL query to get the top 10 levels by playtime.
